# AI4SS Growth & Monetization Playbook

## 1) Information Architecture (already implemented)

- `Skills`: executable workflows by research stage
- `Papers`: evidence base by method/application/policy/review
- `Resources`: tools, datasets, workflow guides, benchmarks, community assets

## 2) SEO Baseline Checklist

- `jekyll-sitemap` enabled (`/sitemap.xml`)
- `robots.txt` added and submit pages excluded
- `hreflang` links for EN/ZH pages
- consistent metadata with `jekyll-seo-tag`
- clean category taxonomy for internal linking

## 3) Traffic Strategy

- publish one high-intent article per week (examples):
  - "Best AI tools for literature review in social science"
  - "How to run reproducible LLM-assisted social science studies"
  - "Open-source repos for computational social science (updated monthly)"
- create one "topic hub" page per category, each linking to 10-20 internal items
- use GitHub and X posts to announce each monthly resource digest page

## 4) Monetization Paths

- Sponsorship slots on homepage (tool spotlight)
- Paid consulting/workshop page for universities/labs
- Affiliate links for courses/books/software (only for trusted products)
- Newsletter with sponsor blocks

## 5) Metrics to Track (monthly)

- search clicks / impressions (Google Search Console)
- top landing pages and click-through rate
- newsletter signups / sponsor inquiries
- number of new resources auto-collected and manually curated
