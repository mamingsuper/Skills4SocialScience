## Perplexity AI

Perplexity AI is an answer engine that uses LLMs to search the web and academic databases, providing synthesized answers with inline citations. Its Academic Focus mode restricts results to scholarly sources.

**Use cases for social science:**
- Rapid evidence gathering on research topics
- Cross-referencing claims with academic sources
- Exploratory literature scanning before systematic review
