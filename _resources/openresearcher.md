## OpenResearcher (TIGER AI Lab)

OpenResearcher is an open-source platform that brings together structured research assets, knowledge graphs, and LLM-powered assistance for building reproducible social science experiments. It includes curated datasets, benchmark tasks, and integration patterns for Claude, GPT, and other agents, so you can iterate quickly with transparent results.

Use it to prototype end-to-end research pipelines, manage citations via knowledge graphs, or deploy multi-step experiments backed by TIGER AI Lab's templates.
