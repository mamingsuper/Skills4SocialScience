# Can Generative AI Improve Social Science?

Christopher A. Bail examines the promise and pitfalls of generative AI across core social science methods. Published in *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*, Vol. 121, No. 21 (2024).

**Key contributions:**
- Survey of AI applications across survey research, experiments, content analysis, and agent-based modeling
- Framework for evaluating when AI augmentation helps vs. harms research quality
- Call for open-source infrastructure for studying human behavior with AI
