# Can Large Language Models Transform Computational Social Science?

Ziems et al. systematically evaluate 13 language models across 25 CSS benchmarks covering classification and generation tasks. Published in *Computational Linguistics* (2024).

**Key findings:**
- Zero-shot LLMs achieve fair agreement with human coders on classification tasks
- LLMs outperform crowdworkers on free-form coding / generation tasks
- Proposed best practices for prompting LLMs in CSS research pipelines
