# Out of One, Many

Argyle et al. show that properly conditioned LLMs can produce synthetic survey responses nearly indistinguishable from real human data across demographics. Published in *Political Analysis* (2023).

**Key contributions:**
- "Silicon sampling" methodology for rapid survey prototyping
- Validation against American National Election Studies (ANES) data
- Discussion of ethical considerations around synthetic human subjects
