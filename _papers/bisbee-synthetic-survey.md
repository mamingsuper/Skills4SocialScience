# Synthetic Replacements for Human Survey Data?

Bisbee et al. provide a critical counterpoint to optimistic claims about LLM-based synthetic survey data. Published in *Political Analysis* (2024).

**Key findings:**
- Systematic biases in LLM-generated responses on politically sensitive topics
- Demographic conditioning does not fully resolve distributional mismatches
- Recommendations for when synthetic data is and is not appropriate
