- **Screen & Filter**: Apply inclusion/exclusion criteria to large paper sets
- **Extract & Summarize**: Pull key findings, methods, sample sizes, and theoretical frameworks
- **Synthesize**: Build thematic evidence matrices and identify research gaps
- **Export**: Format citations for Zotero, Mendeley, or BibTeX

## Usage
```
/literature-review Find seminal papers on AI governance in political science from 2020-2025
