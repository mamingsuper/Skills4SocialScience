# Qualitative Coding Assistant

This skill enables AI agents to assist with qualitative data analysis while preserving methodological rigor and researcher agency.

## Capabilities
- **Open Coding**: Generate initial codes from interview transcripts or field notes
- **Axial Coding**: Identify relationships between codes and build category hierarchies
- **Thematic Analysis**: Cluster codes into themes following Braun & Clarke's framework
- **Inter-Rater Reliability**: Generate coding suggestions for comparison with human coders
- **Export**: Output coded data in ATLAS.ti, NVivo, or CSV formats

## Usage
```
/qualitative-coding Apply thematic analysis to these interview transcripts about citizen participation
```

## Ethical Considerations
- AI-generated codes should always be reviewed and validated by researchers
- Use AI as a "second coder" rather than replacing human interpretation
- Document AI involvement in your methods section
